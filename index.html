		<p class="text">There are one million cybersecurity job openings in 2016. More than 209,000 cybersecurity jobs in the U.S.</br> are unfilled, and postings are up 74% over the past five years, according to a 2015 analysis of numbers</br> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics by Peninsula Press, a project of the Stanford University</br> Journalism Program. Demand for cybersecurity talent is expected to rise to 6 million globally by 2019, with a projected shortfall of 1.5 million.</br>However,50% of these jobs are held by women.</p>
		<p class="heading2"><b>Opinon</b></p>
		<p class="text2">As a woman who is interested in Cybersecurity it is saddening and motivation to here that women are</br> not  rightfully respresented in this occupation. The stats brought forward by Forbes  show that there is</br> room for people of all demographics to join this field. I plan to pursue and learn as much as I can about</br> cyber security.</p>

		<p class="heading"><i>3d Printing</i></p>
		<p class="text"> 3D printing has the ability to change the way things are made in the world today.</br>
		These printers can be used for more than just printing simple documents.In fact, these printers can do</br>
		things like print goods and tools that are used in everyday life. As technology improves, we can only expect </br> the abilities of these machines to grow as well.Because people will be able to make their own goods</br> at home, shipping industry is bound to take a hit.</p>
	<p class="heading2"> <b> My opinion</b> </p>	
	<p class="text2">In my opinon, it is beyond cool to know that someone can sit in the comfort</br>
	of their own homes and create a sculpture or a household tool like a screwdriver. It also sparks</br>
	my curiousity to know what businesses will have to compete for in the future if one in every five homes</br>
	has a 3D printer. I  also wonder what the maintenance is like on these printers.Who do we call when there</br>
	is a malfunction and can they come out to fix it? And if we can make our own products what happens to countries like China?</p>

		<pclass="heading"><i>Ux</i></p>
		<p class="text"> UX or user experience can be a very long process. Studies are conducted to tell how a person</br>
		percieves information and how they react to certain stimuli.When a team is set the the task of designing</br> a product, there are several different approaches to achieving the best result. One approach is the</br> attitudinal vs. Behavioral, and the others are qualitative vs. quantitative, and context of use.</br></p>
		<p class="heading2"> <b>Opinion </b></p>
		<p class="text2">Before I started designing my own applications and studying computer science, I would have never guessed</br> that someone has the job to figuring out how and why people like certain aspects of things.</br> The process is interesting and it combines both a technincal/ art background and psychology.It makes me want to learn how to incorporate these techniques in when designing my own products. Maybe, all developers </br> should take a UX class.</p>

		<pclass="heading"><i>Cloud Computing</i></p>
		<p class="text">cloud computing is the phrase used to describe different scenarios in which computing resource is</br> delivered as a service over a network connection (usually, this is the internet). Cloud computing is</br> therefore a type of computing that relies on sharing a pool of physical and/or virtual resources, rather</br> than deploying local or personal hardware and software. It is somewhat synonymous with the term ‘utility</br> computing’ as users are able to tap into a supply of computing resource rather than manage the equipment</br> needed to generate it themselves; much in the same way as a consumer tapping into the national electricity</br> supply, instead of running their own generator.One of the key characteristics of cloud computing is the flexibility that it offers and one of the ways that flexibility is offered is through</br> scalability.  With cloud computing, the end user usually pays only for the resource they use and so avoids</br> the inefficiencies and expense of any unused capacity.</p>
		
		<p class="heading2"> <b>Opinon </b></p>
		<p class="text2">Cloud computing is extremely relevant in our lives today. Almost every platform such as Google and Apple</br> offer some version of the cloud. This is important because people do not realize how much</br> information they have is being put into the clouds when saving documents and/or passwords. Cloud computing will only get more advanced and relevant because people want a seamless way to have access to all </br> of their papers and pictures at once.</br></p>

		<p class="heading"><i>Big Data</i></p>
		<p class="text">Data now streams from daily life: from phones and credit cards and televisions and computers; from the</br> infrastructure of cities; from sensor-equipped buildings, trains, buses, planes, bridges, and</br> factories.New ways of linking datasets have played a large role in generating new insights. And creative</br> approaches to visualizing data—humans are far better than computers at seeing patterns—frequently prove</br> integral to the process of creating knowledge. Many of the tools now being developed can be used across</br> disciplines as seemingly disparate as astronomy and medicine.These tools can also be used to calculate data</br>that is populated based off of social media posts that rank in the billions for posts a day</br></br></p>
		
		<p class="heading"2><b>Opinion</b></p>
		<p class="text2">Big data is an interesting topic to me. I have never really thought about techniques used to analyze</br> the way people use technology today. The fact that big data can revolutionize  how people stream based off of the metrics is amazing.I wonder if big corporations that want to become more tech savvy will start to hire</br> more postions and do research in Big Data trends.</p>
